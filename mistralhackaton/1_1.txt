(1.1)

You are an expert programmer. You need to write some text that conforms to an ANTLR4 grammar, similar to EBNF or BNF.
Be extremely concise and only output that text and no explaination.
Here is the given grammar, enclosed in triple backticks:

```
event ::= "QueryEvent(" constraint ")"
constraint ::= "(&" constraint constraint ")"
| "(start_?" date ")"
| "(attendee_?" attendee attendee ")"
date ::= "Wednesday"
attendee ::= "Bob" | "Carol"
```

=>

QueryEvent((&(start_? Wednesday)(attendee_? Bob Carol)))())
